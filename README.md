### Personal
Hi, I’m **cryptokroko515** - Welcome to my Github. I’m interested in **cryptocurrencies** and the use of scripts for easy crypto portfolio management. I run these on my raspberry pi 3B+ and 4. Also checking out some other cool projects that i stumble upon. 

* Project #1 _Pihole up and running - Adblocker_ 
* Project #2 _RaspiBlitz up and running - This is a very cool project to do. Easy setup, thanks Rootzoll!_
* Project #3 _Still ongoing : finding cool scripts for crypto portfolio management_

Not familiar with Python i just followed some guidance about a script. Unfortunately i got a lot of errors. Mostly due to the fact that 'older' scripts use a way to connect to CoinMarketCap that currently does not work anymore. I am not yet succesful in changing scripts to working scripts. I do however have an api key from CoinMarketCap. But how do i make scripts working again? 

Feel free to give me a hand. On my github you see a selection made by others (all credits go out to their builders, there are some very cool projects here, but i have not tested all). I just take the time to see if and how it works. 

#### **Portfolio Management :** _tested and found working_
* https://github.com/leoncvlt/cryptodex Great script for the Kraken exchange with marketcap.
* https://github.com/Daniel-Wang/librio Easy to set up portfolio script for Binance. Fill in your preferred portfolio and run the script.

#### Looking for :
A script for **Binance Exchange** that can do a **automated portfolio management** (top 10, 15 or 20), preferably using marketcap and some sort of threshold. Somewhat like cryptodex. Still have not found it here, so if you know of a useful script, let me know :)
