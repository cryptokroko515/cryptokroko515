Hi, I’m cryptokroko515 - Welcome to my Github. I’m interested in crypto scripts and bots for trading and portfolio management. I run these on my raspberry pi 3B+.

Not familiar with Python i just followed some guidance about a script. Unfortunately i got a lot of errors. Mostly due to the fact that 'older' scripts use a way to connect to CoinMarketCap that currently does not work anymore. I am not yet succesful in changing scripts to working scripts.

Feel free to give me a hand. On my github you see a selection Made by others. I take the time to see if and how it works. 

**Portfolio Management :**

https://github.com/leoncvlt Great script for the Kraken exchange. Credits to Leonardo for sharing this, please buy him coffee if you use it.


**Looking for :**
A script for Binance that can do a portfolio management (top 10, 15 or 20), preferably using marketcap. If i can set this up to run every month or so this would be perfect.
If someone is able to change the script of Leonardo to make it work on Binance exchange this would be great.
