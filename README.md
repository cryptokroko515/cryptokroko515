- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m cryptokroko515 

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in crypto scripts for trading and portfolio management. I run these on my raspberry pi.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python.

- Current challenges : scripts that simply don't work on my raspberry pi (3 B+). I have deducted this to the change of the coinmarketcap api (somewhere 2018/2019) and the use of the old way in the scripts gives errors. Unfortunately i am not yet succesful in upgrading scripts ;).

Feel free to help me a hand. Furthermore i get errors with some dependencies.
