## Personal
Hi, I’m **cryptokroko515** - Welcome to my Github. I’m interested in **cryptocurrencies** and the use of scripts for easy crypto portfolio management. I run these on my raspberry pi 3B+ and 4. Also checking out some other cool projects that i stumble upon, like 

* _Pihole - Adblocker
* _RaspiBlitz - This is a very cool project to do. Easy setup, thanks Rootzoll!_

On my github you see a selection made by others (all credits go out to their builders, there are some very cool projects here, but i have not tested all). I just take the time to see if and how it works to get to know code. Focus lies on ETF, Balance, Crypto portfolio.

#### **Portfolio Management :** 

### Kraken
* https://github.com/leoncvlt/cryptodex Great script for the Kraken exchange with marketcap. Please buy Leonardo a coffee. This script works perfectly.
