### Personal
Hi, I’m **cryptokroko515** - Welcome to my Github. I’m interested in **cryptocurrencies** and the use of scripts for easy crypto portfolio management. I run these on my raspberry pi 3B+ and 4. Also checking out some other cool projects that i stumble upon. Not familiar with Python i just followed some guidance about a script. 

* Projects _Pihole up and running - Adblocker__RaspiBlitz up and running - This is a very cool project to do. Easy setup, thanks Rootzoll!_


Feel free to give me a hand. On my github you see a selection made by others (all credits go out to their builders, there are some very cool projects here, but i have not tested all). I just take the time to see if and how it works. 

#### **Portfolio Management :** 
* https://github.com/leoncvlt/cryptodex Great script for the Kraken exchange with marketcap. 
* https://github.com/Daniel-Wang/librio Easy to set up portfolio script for Binance. Fill in your preferred portfolio and run the script.
* https://github.com/kparichay/CryptoETF A script with a lot of options for Binance and also the option to make ETF's and automated portfolio balancing. This seems pretty cool.
